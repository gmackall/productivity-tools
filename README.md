## issue_grapher

A command line tool used to graph the number of reactions that a github issue in the Flutter repository has received over time (i.e., `y axis = reactions` and `x axis = time`). It could easily be extended to work with other repositories, if anyone ever wanted this.

## dependabot_app

A dummy Flutter app, the sole purpose of which is to mirror the maven dependencies used by the Flutter engine to subscribe to dependabot updates, so that I remember to update them in the Flutter engine.
